The code on this repository is intended to be used to share media content with various networks such as Torrent and Usenet while protecting your privacy through a VPN. The main idea is to provide access where Internet censors and content restriction apply. I totally discourage using this code for any piracy reasons.

The stack can be run in any Linux box.\
Besides Plex transcoding, all other apps and functions are super light and a basic Raspberry Pi is able to handle the load.

All the apps are pre-configured and integrated. Therefore, with a few clicks you can start adding Indexers to the configurations and tinkering to your liking.

**IMPORTANT:** I strongly recommend rotating all the API keys and changing all the passwords.

# Usage

## 1. Check your parameters

It is necessary to set a few parameters to match your environment.
Check your user id and gid. To get this info, go to your shell and run:

```shell
id
```

The result should be something like;

```shell
uid=1000(my_user) gid=1000(my_user) groups=1000(my_user)
```

After that, check your timezone. For that, run:

```shell
cat /etc/timezone
```

The result should be something like;

```shell
America/Toronto
```

Save these values for later reference.

## 2.Create dotenv (.env) file

Copy from the example and generate a new .env file.

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

## 3. Edit dotenv (.env) file

Edit the newly created .env file and change the `UID, GID, and TIMEZONE` parameters to the values you gathered from steps 1 and 2.

In addition, set the `DOMAIN` variable for the certificate generation and the reverse proxy configuration.

Lastly, configure the `VPN_PROVIDER`, choose from `protonvpn` or `nordvpn` and fill the variables accordingly.

It will look something like this;

```
# System Parameters
UID=1000
GID=1000
TIMEZONE=America/Toronto
UMASK=022
DOMAIN=localhost

# VPN Configurations
VPN_PROVIDER=protonvpn
PROTONVPN_COUNTRY_AND_SERVER=nl-free-127.protonvpn.net
PROTONVPN_KEY=KLjfIMiuxPskM4+DaSUDmL2uSIYKJ9Wap+CHvs0Lfkw=
```

### 3.1. ProtonVPN

You will need to log in to ProtonVPN portal to download your key, follow these steps;

- Log in to ProtonVPN and go to Downloads â†’ WireGuard configuration.
- Enter a name for the key, and select features to enable like NetShield and VPN Accelerator & click create.
- Generated config might look something like below;

```[Interface]
# Key for <name>
# VPN Accelerator = on
PrivateKey = KLjfIMiuxPskM4+DaSUDmL2uSIYKJ9Wap+CHvs0Lfkw=
Address = 10.2.0.2/32
DNS = 10.2.0.1

[Peer]
# NL-FREE#128
PublicKey = jbTC1lYeHxiz1LNSJHQMKDTq6sHgcWxkBwXvt7GWo1E=
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
Endpoint = 91.229.23.180:51820
```

- Only thing needed from the above config is PrivateKey.
- See https://protonvpn.com/support/wireguard-configurations/ for more info.

With the values from the page, change the `PROTONVPN_KEY` and `PROTONVPN_COUNTRY_AND_SERVER`.

**IMPORTANT:** To use a server that is best for you, please check the details in the ProtonVPN Docker page; https://github.com/tprasadtp/protonvpn-docker#protonvpn_server

### 3.2. NordVPN

Please visit https://support.nordvpn.com/Connectivity/Linux/1905092252/How-to-log-in-to-NordVPN-on-Linux-with-a-token.htm for more instructions on how to get your token. And https://github.com/bubuntux/nordvpn for more configuration parameters for the NordVPN container.

NordVPN by default will pick the best server for you, otherwise, please add the value in the `NORDVPN_COUNTRY_AND_OR_SERVER` variable. There is a comprehensive list at https://nordvpn.com/servers/ .

## 4. Generate the certificate

At this moment the stack only supports self-signed certificates.

Go back to the `.env` file and look for the section about the certificate if you want to change any parameter.
An example is like;

```
# Certificate details
CERT_COUNTRY=CS
CERT_STATE=Classified
CERT_CITY=Classified
CERT_ORGANIZATION=Classified
CERT_OU=Classified
CERT_FQDN=${DOMAIN} # it will use the previously declared DOMAIN variable
```

After you have configured the parameters in the `.env` file, you can generate a certificate by running the command;

```
make generate_certificate
```

This will create the `server.key`, `server.crt`, and `server.pfx` in the `/certs/` folder.

### 4.1. Use your own certificate

If you have your own certificate, just copy them to the `/certs` folder using the exact names.

Remember, the `server.key`, `server.crt`, and `server.pfx` have to match the `uid` and `gid`, and the permissions have to be `644` for the `.crt` and `600` for the `.key` and `.pfx`.

## 5. Enable / Disable Apps

In the same `.env` file, edit the Docker container profile to enabled/disabled for the apps in the stack.

The only **REQUIRED** app is the `VPN_PROVIDER` as the stack is tightly coupled to it.

It will look like this;

```
# Default Apps' Profiles (enabled/disabled)
BAZARR_PROFILE=disabled
CALIBRE_PROFILE=disabled
CALIBREWEB_PROFILE=disabled
FLARESOLVERR_PROFILE=enabled
JACKETT_PROFILE=disabled
LAZYLIBRARIAN_PROFILE=disabled
LIDARR_PROFILE=disabled
MYLAR_PROFILE=disabled
NGINX_PROFILE=enabled
NZBGET_PROFILE=enabled
NZBHYDRA2_PROFILE=enabled
OVERSEERR_PROFILE=enabled
PLEX_PROFILE=enabled
PROTONVPN_PROFILE=enabled
QBITTORRENT_PROFILE=enabled
RADARR_PROFILE=enabled
READARR_PROFILE=disabled
SONARR_PROFILE=enabled
TAUTULLI_PROFILE=enabled

# NOT Default Apps' Profiles (enabled/disabled)
NORDVPN_PROFILE=disabled
PROWLARR_PROFILE=disabled
```

## 6. Run the containers

Now that everything is set, please run the containers by using the command below;

```shell
docker-compose --profile enabled up --detach
```

**OR**

```shell
make start
```

## 7. Rotate your keys

All the services are pre-configured, therefore they already have API keys set.

It is **strongly recommended rotating all of them** for the sake of security.

## 8. Shutting it down

Now that everything is working, if you need to bring it down to change parameters and make adjustments, please run the command below;

```shell
docker-compose --profile enabled stop
```

**OR**

```shell
make stop
```

## 9. Backup

Now that everything is **fully working**. Make sure you create a backup of your configurations and changes, in order to perform the backup operation, please run;

```shell
make backup
```

This command will generate a backup of all the config folders.

# App Links

Some apps are available on both, HTTP and HTTPS, whereas some are only available in one protocol.

Not all apps are fully working through the reverse proxy (Nginx). I am still working on it.

# Bandwith Control

By default, both downloaders, qBitTorrent and NzbGet, are configured to limit from 8AM to 11:59PM to;

- **Download Rate** - 1 Gbps
- **Upload Rate** - 30 Mbps (only applicable to qBitTorrent)

Outside of these hours, no speed control applied.\
If desired, it is possible to change or disable the settings in these app's configs.

---

## Revert to original state

If you need to revert to the original code and configs, simply run;

```shell
make clean
```

---

## Known Issues and future improvements

1. Lidarr is not pre-configured for the indexers because it didn't allow to add for a category issue
2. Sonarr is not configured yet on HTTPS, it requires more tweaking
3. Mylar doesn't work with qBittorrent and Nzbget using a self-signed certificate
4. Lazylibarian doesn't work with qBittorrent using a self-signed certificate.

If you can help working on any of these issues and require more information, please feel free to open a issue and reach out.

## Clean up everything (including media folder)

**IMPORTANT:** This will **ERASE** every file on your media folder!

```shell
make clean_all
```
